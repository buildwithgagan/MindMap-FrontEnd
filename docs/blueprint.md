## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Use a clean, light gray or off-white (#F7F7F7) similar to Apple's website for a minimalist look.
- Primary Action Color: Use a subtle blue or gray (#007AFF or #8E8E93) for interactive elements.
- Accents: Use very limited accent colors like a slightly darker gray or a muted blue for highlights.
- Font: 'SF Pro Display' or 'San Francisco', the system font for Apple devices, ensuring a modern and clean look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, clear icons inspired by Apple's design language, focusing on recognizability and minimalism.
- Cards: Large border radius (24px+) with soft, diffused shadows instead of harsh borders, maintaining a smooth, rounded aesthetic.
- Ensure the Sidebar collapses into a Bottom Navigation Bar for mobile views, following Apple's responsive design principles.
- Use subtle, smooth animations for transitions and interactions to enhance the user experience, mirroring Apple's fluid UI.
